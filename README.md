# Introduction
This is the 3D printable "Rising Sun" watch mainspring winder for watchmaking hobbyists. The RS nickname is derived from the fingergrip knurling pattern of on the top of the winder. This is the 2021 solution to hobbiyst mainspring winding woes.

Watch mainspring winding for hobbyists has always been a problem, as most of us cannot afford the $1000 Bergeon set to wind their vintage unbranded mainspring barrel. In the worst case scenario, the appropriate size just isnt available. This forces most casual hobbyists to resort to handwinding, which will definately kink or damage the mainspring. Worry not, as I have come to your rescue.

This FreeCAD based mainspring winder is designed to be 3D printed, and will approximately cost $5/set by most 3D print service providers (use eBay to find someone near you). The design is parameterized, allowing you to dynamically change the size/dimensions of the winder and the entire design will be recalculated accordingly.

The RS mainspring winder is a pleasure to use when constructed correctly, and it will not kink or damage the mainspring due to PLA material being softer than steel, but is tough enough to withstand the winding stress. Due to this, it may even be viable for professional vintage watch restorers.

# The Design
There are four parts to the RS mainspring winder:
- **The housing barrel**. This 3D printed part has a barrel that houses the mainspring and plunger, and the knurling pattern on the top is akin to a rising sun.
- **The winder base**. This 3D printed part holds the anchor which latches to the mainspring hole and winds it up. When reversed, it holds the actual mainspring barrel in place for plunging the mainspring back in.
- **The plunger**. This 3D printed part pushes the mainspring out of the housing barrel into the actual mainspring barrel.
- **The anchor**. Fashion this part out of a stapler clip and insert into the hole on the winder beside the arbour. This part is too small to be 3D printed with enough strength/accuracy.

Recommended 3D printing options:
- **Material: PLA** (needed for the accuracy over PETG, Nylon, etc)
- **Filling: 100%** (lower values are not recommended, parts may crumble under stress)
- **Layer thickness: 200 Âµm** or better
- **Printer: Prusa I3 MK3** or better
- **Colour: White** for all (optionally orange for plunger if desired)

# Building and using the RS winder

##### TODO: Add link to FreeCAD installer, mention 0.19 works.
##### TODO: Add link to FreeCAD project file.

These are the steps to customize and build the winder:
1. Download and install FreeCAD. Why FreeCAD? It is lightweight, free, open-source, works on any machine, doesnt spy on you, and doesnt constantly nag you to pay for useless premium features you will never need.
2. Download the RS mainspring winder FreeCAD project file and open it.
3. Open up the Parameter spreadsheet (on the right pane).
4. Go through the parameter descriptions, and then tune the values to match your needs.
5. Click on each part and then export as STL files (winder, housing, plunger).
6. Print these three parts with the recommended print settings.
7. Fashion a stapler pin as an anchor and insert it into the hole beside the arbour on the winder. Use a file if you need to trim it down.
8. I recommend cleaning/washing the parts and then lubricating all contact points with whatever you use for your mainsprings.

These are the steps to using the winder:
1. Place the plunger into the housing barrel.
2. Place the mainspring into the arbour on the winder part. Be careful not to break it.
3. Use a tweezer to latch the anchor onto the mainspring hole (see video).
4. Carefully put the housing barrel and winder parts together , careful not to wind in reverse as this will unlatch the anchor.
5. Wind the mainspring until end tail of the mainspring sticks out. Use a tweezer to push it in **until it cannot be seen**. If it is refusing to go in, keep winding a little bit more to make it easier to push in, but not too much.
6. Once done, **unwind** by going in the **reverse direction until there is no more resistance**. The anchor will naturally unlatch, allowing you to just pull off the winder part. If the mainspring is still latched, then gently unwind a little bit more. Do not overdo it as the hook may scratch the mainspring.
7. Next, reverse the winder and place the actual mainspring barrel inside it. Plug it back into the housing barrel, apply some force to hold it together, and press the plunger.
8. Enjoy the rest of your day knowing that it just cost you $5 and a measly stapler clip to wind up a fancy Swiss mainspring, and will probably last you another 100 watch services. For most of us, thats the rest of our hobbyist life.
