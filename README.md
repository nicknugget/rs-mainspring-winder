# Introduction
This is the 3D printable "Rising Sun" watch mainspring winder for hobbyists. The RS nickname is derived from the fingergrip knurling pattern of on the top of the winder.

Watch mainspring winding for hobbyists has always been a problem, as most cannot afford the $1000 Bergeon set to wind their vintage unbranded mainspring barrel. In the worst case scenario, the appropriate size just isnt available. This is a huge issue for casual hobbyists, who typically resort to handwinding which will definately kink or damage the mainspring.

This FreeCAD based mainspring winder is designed to be 3D printed. It parameterized, allowing you to dynamically change the size/dimensions of the winder and the entire design will be recalculated accordingly. The RS winder is a pleasure to use when printed correctly, and may even be viable for professional vintage watch restorers.

# The Design
There are four parts to the RS mainspring winder:
- **The housing body**. This 3D printed part has a barrel that houses the mainspring and plunger, and the knurling pattern on the top is akin to a rising sun.
- **The winder base**. This 3D printed part holds the anchor which latches to the mainspring hole and winds it up. When reversed, it holds the actual mainspring barrel in place for plunging the mainspring back in.
- **The plunger**. This 3D printed part pushes the mainspring out when windingis complete/
- **The anchor**. Fashion this part out of a stapler clip and insert into the hole on the winder beside the arbour. This part is too small to be 3D printed with enough strength/accuracy.

Recommended 3D printing options:
- **Material: PLA** (needed for the accuracy over PETG, Nylon, etc)
- **Filling: 100%** (lower is not good, parts will crumble under stress)
- **Layer thickness: 200 Âµm** or better
- **Printer: Prusa I3 MK3** or better
- **Colour: White** for all (optionally orange for plunger if desired)
