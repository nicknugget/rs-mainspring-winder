# Introduction
This project helps watchmaking hobbyists build 3D printable "Rising Sun" mainspring winders. Everything provided here is free and open source. This is the 2021 solution to hobbyist mainspring winding woes and it proudly comes with **absolutely zero warranty**. Use it at your own risk.

Watch mainspring winding for hobbyists has always been a problem, as most of us cannot afford the $1000 Bergeon set to wind vintage unbranded mainsprings/barrels. Or sometimes, the appropriate size just isn't available. This forces most casual hobbyists to resort to handwinding or other similar stunts, which will definitely kink or damage the mainspring. Worry not, as I have come to your rescue.

This mainspring winder is designed using FreeCAD to be easily 3D printed with no post-processing/finishing required. It will approximately cost $5/set by most 3D print service providers (use eBay to find someone near you). The design is parameterized, allowing you to dynamically change the size/dimensions of the winder and the entire design will be recalculated accordingly.

The RS mainspring winder works very well when constructed correctly, and can wind in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. It will not kink or damage the mainspring due to the PLA material being softer than steel, yet tough enough to withstand the winding stress.

**Watch this Youtube video [here](https://youtu.be/OAfQTk89P3s) to better understand the RS winder parts and how it works.**

# RS Winder Parts Description

There are five parts to the RS mainspring winder:
- **The housing barrel**. This 3D printed part has a barrel that houses the mainspring and plunger, and the knurling pattern on the top is akin to a rising sun.
- **The winder base**. This 3D printed part holds the anchor which latches to the mainspring hole and winds it up.
- **The barrel bowl**. This 3D printed part holds the actual mainspring barrel in place for safely plunging the mainspring back in.
- **The plunger**. This 3D printed part pushes the mainspring out of the housing barrel into the actual mainspring barrel.
- **The anchor**. Fashion this part out of a stapler pin and insert into the hole on the winder beside the arbour.

**NOTE:** *The anchor is too small to be 3D printed with enough strength/accuracy, hence a metal part is **required** for the RS winder to work. A stapler pin is an everyday item accessible to everyone, and is perfect for this task.*

# Building the RS winder

Recommended 3D printing options:
- **Material: PLA** (best for high accuracy prints). Avoid cheap or low quality materials.
- **Filling: 100%** (parts may crumble under stress if lower).
- **Layer thickness: 200 Âµm** or better.
- **Printer: Prusa I3 MK3** or better.
- **Color: White** for all (optionally orange for plunger if desired). Or whatever.

Steps to build your RS mainspring winder:
1. Use a caliper to measure your mainspring barrel inner and outer diameters. The outer diameter includes the main wheel (gear).
2. Download the latest rs-winder-vXXX.zip from the [release section](https://github.com/vishnu350/rs-mainspring-winder/releases).
   - Select your winder base part STL file (standard size).
   - Select your housing barrel and plunger part STL files. Size is based on mainspring barrel inner diameter, make sure to select matching sizes for both parts.
   - Select your bowl part STL files. Size is based on the mainspring barrel outer diameter.
   - Alternatively, you may customize and generate these files yourself (see 'customizing' steps below).
3. 3D print the four STL files with the recommended 3D print settings, or just send it to someone on eBay to help you with that.
4. Fashion a stapler pin (with a pair of pliers) into an anchor, and insert it into any of the holes on the winder base part. The hole size selected should ideally fit both the staple pin and mainspring hole.
5. If you printed the winder base version with an arbor hole, then find an appropriate dowel pin to insert into it (2mm/3mm for normal/large winders respectively).
6. Clean all parts and then lubricate all contact points appropriately.

# Customizing/Generating the RS winder

Steps to customizing your RS winder:
1. Download and install [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org/downloads.php). It is an amazing piece of free and open-source software.
2. Download the RS mainspring winder [FreeCAD project file](https://github.com/vishnu350/rs-mainspring-winder/blob/main/rs-winder.FCStd) and open it.
3. Open up the parameter spreadsheet on the left pane by double clicking on it.
4. Go through the parameter descriptions, and then tune the values to match your needs. You will need a caliper to measure your mainspring/barrel/etc dimensions.
5. Make sure a proper font file is selected for *Version_Text* on the housing part. *Ubuntu-B.ttf* is included in the repo.
6. Recompute the entire design by pressing CTRL+R, and check if the parts look alright.
7. Click on each part and then export as STL files (winder, housing, bowl, plunger).

To automatically generate the STL files for the various different sizes of all the RS winder parts, clone the repo and execute the Python FreeCAD script using the following command:<br />
`freecadcmd generate_stl.py`

**NOTE:** *Only customize the RS winder if the pre-generated STL files do not fit your needs.*

# Using the RS winder
1. Place the plunger into the housing barrel.
2. Place the mainspring into the arbour on the winder part.
3. Use a tweezer to latch the anchor onto the mainspring hole.
4. Carefully put the housing barrel and winder parts together. Take care **not to wind in reverse** as this will unlatch the anchor.
5. Wind the mainspring until (both) end tails of the mainspring sticks out. Gently push it in **such that both tails are in the barrel**. Continue to wind a little bit more until it goes in completely and can no longer be seen.
6. Once done, **unwind** by twisting in the reverse direction until there is **no more backpressure** from the mainspring. **The anchor should naturally unlatch**, allowing you to easily take off the winder base part. If the mainspring is still latched, then gently unwind a little bit more.
7. Next, place the actual mainspring barrel inside the barrel bowl recess and plug it into the housing barrel.
8. Place the housing+bowl parts on a level surface, apply some downward force to hold it together, and then press the plunger. All done!
9. Enjoy the rest of your day knowing that it just cost you $5 and a measly stapler pin to wind up a fancy Swiss mainspring.

# Warnings and Tips
- As stated before, everything provided here comes with **ABSOLUTELY ZERO WARRANTY**. Only use this on your beloved grandfather's vintage Rolex if you are confident in doing so.
- Take you time to properly **fashion the stapler pin to the right size**. If it is not correct, it will easily get unhooked while winding or may even cause the winding base arbour to break.
- When initially placing the housing barrel on the winder base with the latched mainspring, **do not forcefully ram the mainspring into position**. Watch the [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/OAfQTk89P3s) for an elegant way to do this.
- Be very careful with the winder base part! Although it may appear sturdy, **dropping it will most likely break the arbour**.
- Double check if the plunger base is **level, round and flat**. If it isnt, work it down with a metal file or sandpaper.
- Make sure to **apply downward force** while plunging the mainspring back in, otherwise it may fail to pop back into the barrel.
- It is good to **lubricate** the housing barrel walls and mainspring before winding it in. This reduces winding stress and also makes it easier to plunge later on.
- When unwinding, be gentle so as to not scratch the mainspring with the anchor.
- It is recommended to practice first with spare mainsprings/barrels to get a feel of using the RS winder.
- The barrel bowl part can also be used to snap the barrel lid back on, as well as holding it during assembly/disassembly service.
 
# Future Updates
- Split winders to three classes: large (pocket watch), medium (wrist watches), and small (women's wrist watches).
- Store common parameters/dimensions for known movements in a library file.
- Further tweak design for better quality and ease of use.
